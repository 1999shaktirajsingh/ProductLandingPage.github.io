<h1 align="center">Product Landing Page</h1>
<p align="center">Hey guys, this is a basic product landing page. I took a racquet of Yonex company as the product. If you are badminton lover then you must be knowing about this racquet. Data put on website are just random, no relation with the actual data. This is just an example, not official Yonex site. This project is made using HTML and CSS, using flexbox concept and a bit of media query just to pass a test case.</p>
